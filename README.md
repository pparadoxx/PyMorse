This is a simple Morse Code Translator written using Python3. It will take an input 
and index it as the translated telecommunication encoded text.

Valid Inputs are:
- E - Lets the program know you want to encrypt the next text in Morse.
- D - Lets the program know you want to decrpyt the next text in Morse.

# How does it work
Its based on an old method of encoding text sent through telecommunication lines called
Morse. Morse was invented by a man named Samuel Morse in 1832. It is still even almost
